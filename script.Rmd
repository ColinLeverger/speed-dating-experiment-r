# Introduction

I am going to explore a Speed Dating dataset provided by Kaggle, which can be found at the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment/.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# setwd("/Users/colinleverger/Documents/Experiments/kaggle/speed-dating-experiment")
```

The dataset is provided with its key, which is a Word document you will need to quickly go through to understand my work properly.

# Initialisations
****
## Packages

Let's first load a few libraries...

```{r, results="hide", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load libraries & packages
library(dplyr)        # Data manipulation
library(reshape2)     # Data reshaping for ggplot
library(ggplot2)      # Data visualization
library(plotly)       # Dynamic data visualization
library(RColorBrewer) # Colors on plots
library(readr)        # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function
library(dataQualityR) # DQR generation
library(randomForest) # Random Forest for variable importance
```

## Color palettes for plots

This is optional, but if we decide to change the color of the `ggplot` afterwards, it could be useful.

```{r}
cbPalette  <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
cbbPalette <- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
```

## Read the data
```{r, results="hide", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
missing.types <- c("NA", "")
df <- read.csv("input/Speed Dating Data.csv", na.strings = missing.types, stringsAsFactors = F)
# "income", "tuition" and "mn_sat" features should be read as numerical
df$income  <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", df$income))
df$tuition <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", df$tuition))
df$mn_sat  <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", df$mn_sat))
```

# Clean the data
****
In this part of the analysis, we will clean the dataset and work on variables to have a better exploration of the dataset. This procedure includes various checks, imputations, type changes...

## Generate the Data Quality Report, before the feature engineering

The Data Quality Report (DQR) is a good way to have an overall view of the quality of the dataset. Which feature has the most missing values? How many unique values are present for this or this feature? Etc. It is a very good help to understand and clean the data.

```{r}
checkDataQuality(
  df,
  out.file.num = "dqr/DQR_cont.csv",
  out.file.cat = "dqr/DQR_cat.csv"
)

# Read the DQR on the disk
dqr.cont <- read.csv("dqr/DQR_cont.csv")
dqr.cat  <- read.csv("dqr/DQR_cat.csv")

# Classify features in function of their missingness for better analysis
feat.cont.missing20_100 <- dqr.cont[dqr.cont$missing.percent > 20,]
feat.cont.missing20     <- dqr.cont[dqr.cont$missing.percent <= 20 & dqr.cont$missing.percent > 0,]
# View(feat.cont.missing20)
```

## Imputations with missing values

If we take a closer look at the data, we notice that there are a lot of features which have exactly 79 missing values.

```{r}
head(dqr.cont[dqr.cont$missing == 79, c(1,2,3)], 10)
```

The question is: is there a pattern? Can we impute, can we clean up this mess?

```{r}
val1 <- feat.cont.missing20[feat.cont.missing20$missing == 79,]$X
sample_n(df[is.na(df$imprelig), c(1:10)], 10)
```

It appears that nothing very interesting can be deducted from this. Indeed, most of the missing values are preferences of the people considered. Impossible to impute that!

In the same approach, there is a lot of missing values for `age_o` and `race_o` features.

```{r}
missing.age_o.pid <- unique(df[is.na(df$age_o),]$pid)
missing.race_o.pid <- unique(df[is.na(df$race_o),]$pid)
sample_n(subset(df, iid %in% missing.age_o.pid)[, c(1:10)], 10)
```

Nothing very interesting here neither.

## Deal with missing id

According to our DQR, there is one missing `id` in our dataset. It should be fairly easy to deduct the good value. Let's find and replace it.

```{r}
# Find the iid of the only missing id
iid <- df[is.na(df$id),]$iid
# Assign this iid' id to the missing iid..
df[is.na(df$id),]$id <- head(df[df$iid == iid,]$id, 1)
```

_Note to myself: it is not useful to make the process generic, the data will not change anyway..._
 
## Deal with missing pid

There is 10 missing `pid` (partner’s iid number) in the dataset. Since there is no `iid` missing, we could probably impute quite easily. 

Every person has an unique id in the entire dataset: `iid`. A person has also an unique identifier within the wave: `id`. Each person meet another person, and we have both the `iid` and the `id` of this person met (respectively mapped to `pid` and `partner`). Therefore, if there is 10 `pid` missing and no `partner` missing, the `partner` value will lead us within the wave to this missing `pid`.

```{r}
# Show the missing pid
df[is.na(df$pid), c(1,2,11,12)]
# Save the partner number for the wave
partner.pid <- unique(df[is.na(df$pid),]$partner)
# Save the wave number
wave.pid <- unique(df[is.na(df$pid),]$wave)
# Show the iid we are looking for
unique(df[df$wave == wave.pid & df$id == partner.pid,]$iid)
df[is.na(df$pid),]$pid <- 128
```

## Work on field feature
```{r}
# Plot raw field
df$field <- tolower(df$field)
barplot(
  table(df$field),
  main = "Careers"
)

# How many unique field do we have?
paste("There is", length(unique(df$field)), "different uncoded fields.")
```

We cannot use this column to analyse the data. Indeed, all the values in this column were directly given by the users, and the latter may write anything, including nonsense values such as "I don’t know".

Instead, we will rely on the `field_coded` variable, which should have 18 levels.

```{r}
# Show coded field
ordered(unique(df$field_cd))
```

## Work on career feature
```{r}
# Plot raw career
df$career <- tolower(df$career)
barplot(
  table(df$career),
  main = "Careers"
)
# How many unique carrer do we have?
paste("There is", length(unique(df$career)), "different uncoded carreers.")

# Show coded career (should have 17 levels)
ordered(unique(df$career_c))
```

## Work on zip codes

We see that there is a lot of `zipcode`s equals to 0, and these should be changed to NAs.

```{r}
# Assign NA to all the zip codes equals to 0
df[df$zipcode == 0 & !is.na(df$zipcode),]$zipcode <- NA
```

## Standardise waves

It is said on the word doc linked to the data that the waves 6 to 9 are different because people were asked to note their preferences from 1 to 10 rather than allocating a hundred points on features.

```{r}
# Show waves 6 to 9
head(df[df$wave > 5 & df$wave < 10, c(1,16:20)])
# Show wave 3 to compare
head(df[df$wave == 3, c(1,16:20)])
```

However, we see above that the data seems to already be standardised - no work for us here!

## Change Male and Female attributes

To enhance comprehension, I have chosen to display `W` instead if `0` for women, and `M` instead of `1` for males. This little modification will not have any negative impact on analysis, because we will not do any machine learning.

```{r}
df[df$gender == 0,]$gender <- "W"
df[df$gender == 1,]$gender <- "M"
```

# Analyse the data
****
## Gender analysis
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Plot gender repartition in waves
ggplot(gender.rep.over.waves, aes(x = wave, y = value, fill = factor(gender))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Gender") +

## Age analysis

## Does race really matters?

```{r}
# Find samerace importance on imprace
imprace.importance <- df %>%
  group_by(samerace, imprace) %>%
  summarise(
    sum.match = sum(match),
    total = n()
  ) 
# Eliminate imprace = 0 because the scale is from 1 to 10
imprace.importance <- imprace.importance[imprace.importance$imprace > 0 & !is.na(imprace.importance$imprace),]

# Plot samerace over imprace 
ggplot(imprace.importance, aes(x = imprace, y = (sum.match / total) * 100, fill = factor(samerace))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Samerace") +
  xlab("Imprace") + ylab("Count (%)") + ggtitle("Importance of `imprace`") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbPalette)
```

Surprisingly, the attribute `imprace` doesn't seem to have a big impact on the process. Indeed, it is not because `imprace = 10` and `samerace = 1` that there is significantly more matches... The distribution is nearly flat, we could just notice a few less matches for `imprace = 10` and `imprace = 8`.

## Does age really matter?
```{r}
# Group df by age and age_0
age.analysis <- df %>%
  group_by(age, age_o) %>%
  summarise(
    n.people = n(), 
    n.matches = sum(match)
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(age) & !is.na(age_o))

# Filter with age difference > 5 years, and with more than 5 matches
age.diff <- age.analysis %>%
  filter(age - age_o >= 0) %>%
  mutate(n.years = age - age_o) %>%
  group_by(n.years) %>%
  summarise(
    n.matches = sum(n.matches)
  ) %>%
  arrange(n.years)

# Graph result
ggplot(age.diff[age.diff$n.years < 20,], aes(x = n.years, y = n.matches)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  xlab("Number of years of difference between people's age") + 
  ylab("Number of matches") + ggtitle("Does age really matter?") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbPalette)
```

## Does correlation between participant’s and partner’s ratings of interests really matter?

```{r}
# Group df with int_corr and gender
int_corr.analysis <- df %>%
  group_by(int_corr) %>%
  summarise(
    my.n = n(),
    n.matches = sum(match)
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(int_corr))

int_corr.analysis$n.matches.cat[int_corr.analysis$n.matches >= 0 & 
                                  int_corr.analysis$n.matches < 10] <- "few"  
int_corr.analysis$n.matches.cat[int_corr.analysis$n.matches >= 10 & 
                                  int_corr.analysis$n.matches < 20] <- "middle"  
int_corr.analysis$n.matches.cat[int_corr.analysis$n.matches >= 20] <- "lot"  

# Plot result
ggplotly(ggplot(int_corr.analysis, aes(x = int_corr, y = my.n, fill = factor(n.matches.cat))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Matches") +
  xlab("int_cor") + ylab("Count") + 
  ggtitle(paste("Does correlation between participant’s and partner’s \n", 
                "ratings of interests really matter? \n", sep = "<br>")))
```

## Are people more willing to meet someone working in the same field?

```{r}
# Temp variable to store `pid`
temp <- df$pid

# Blank list to store the partner coded career
my.career_c_o <- list()
# Loop to create the column we need in df
# The goal is to add the coded career of the person met to each row
for(i in 1:length(temp)){
  my.career_c_o[i] <- head(df[df$iid == temp[i],]$career_c, 1)
}
```

```{r}
# Copy df to avoid working on the real data
df.copy <- df
# Add the coded field of partner
df.copy$career_c_o <- unlist(my.career_c_o)

# Explore...
var1 <- df.copy %>%
  filter(match == 1) %>%
  group_by(career_c, career_c_o) %>%
  summarise(my.n = n()) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(career_c) & !is.na(career_c_o))

# Heatmap to display result
ggplotly(ggplot(var1, aes(career_c, career_c_o)) + 
  geom_tile(aes(fill = my.n), colour = "white") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue") + 
  ggtitle(paste("Are people more willing to meet \n", 
                "someone working in the same field? \n", sep = "<br>")))
```

## Is income important to get more matches?

```{r}
# Dummie analysis: group by match and see extremums, mean, median...
df %>%
  filter(!is.na(income)) %>%
  group_by(match, gender) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(income),
    median = median(income),
    max = max(income),
    min = min(income),
    n.matches = sum(match)
  )
```

Nothing very interesting to see here - there is still a lot of missing values in `income`...

## Is it important to be on the firsts dates to have match?

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(match == 1) %>%
  group_by(order, gender) %>%
  summarise(
    n.matches = sum(match)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = order, y = n.matches, fill = factor(gender))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Gender") +
  xlab("Order") + ylab("Number of matches") + 
  ggtitle("Is it important to be on the firsts dates to have match?") 

```

## Is "proxy for intelligence" `mn_sat` important in this dataset?

```{r}
# How many missing values?
dqr.cont[dqr.cont$X == 'mn_sat', c(1:4)]

# 62 percents, that is a lot. Look what we can get by deleting all the missing values...
ggplotly(df %>%
  filter(!is.na(mn_sat)) %>%
  group_by(mn_sat) %>%
  summarise(
    n.matches = sum(match)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mn_sat, y = n.matches)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  xlab("mn_sat") + ylab("Number of matches") + 
  ggtitle("Is `mn_sat` important in this dataset?"))
```

Apparently, the more you were "intelligent", the more you had matches during the events... Meaningless due to a very hudge amount of missing values... Notice that it was not good neither to be "too inteligent".

# Create data to feed Gephi
****

In this dataset, there are connections between people. It fits well for a graph analysis, and we will thus use Gephi to do so.

```{r}
# Isolate iid (1) -> pid (12)
gephi <- df[,c(1, 12)]
# Rename columns to match Gephi's prerequisites
names(gephi)[1] <- paste("Source")
names(gephi)[2] <- paste("Target")
# Convert Target into integer (to avoid having 10.0, 11.0...)
# We don't want to have ".0" to have a good analysis with Gephi
gephi$Target <- as.integer(gephi$Target)
# Write on disk
write_csv(gephi, "gephi.csv")
```
